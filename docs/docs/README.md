## Introduction
![welcome](../assets/top-banner.png)

Lovense offers several solutions for integrating with our products and services. Web camming and games are the most common integrations of our technology.

If you are developing a live webcam site or something else in the live webcam industry, choose from our [Cam Solutions](#cam-solutions-with-lovense-connect).

If you are developing a game integration, personal project, or something else outside the webcam industry, our [Standard Solutions](#standard-solutions-with-lovense-remote) are usually the best choice.

If you are developing a mobile or PC application, choose our [Native SDK](#native-sdk) available for iOS, Android, and Windows.

<!-- If you are in the camming industry, choose from our [Cam Solutions](#cam-solutions-with-lovense-connect). For other integrations, choose from our [Standard Solutions](#standard-solutions-with-lovense-remote). For a mobile integration, choose our [Native SDK](#native-sdk). -->

If you have any questions or additional requirements, please [contact us](mailto:developer@mail.lovense.com).

## Cam Solutions (with Lovense Connect)

Whether you run a cam site or a service for the camming industry, our Cam Solutions will let you easily integrate our best-in-class technology into your platform. Add tip-activated vibrations to your platform and let your users join the 90,000+ models using Lovense on cam.

### Cam Extension for Chrome

Our Chrome extension - the most powerful camming tool for tip-activated toy control.

Broadcast with any Lovense toy(s) and access a full range of custom features like tip vibrations, games, chatroom notifications, video overlays, and more.

Cam sites we've integrated with this way:

### Cam Kit for Web

Integrate a JS file into your webpage to embed our core features and get basic functions like tip-activated vibrations.

Offers you more control over the user's setup process, but fewer features for models.

## Standard Solutions (with Lovense Remote)

Our Standard Solutions enable sending commands to Lovense toys by HTTPS or WebSocket. This is most commonly used by developers of games and other apps.

### Standard API
