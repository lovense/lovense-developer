# Introduction


Whether you run a cam site or a service for the camming industry, our Cam Solutions will let you easily integrate our best-in-class technology into your platform. Add tip-activated vibrations to your platform and let your users join the 90,000+ models using Lovense on cam.

## Cam Extension for Chrome

Our Chrome extension - the most powerful camming tool for tip-activated toy control.

Broadcast with any Lovense toy(s) and access a full range of custom features like tip vibrations, games, chatroom notifications, video overlays, and more.

Cam sites we've integrated with this way:

## Cam Kit for Web

Integrate a JS file into your webpage to embed our core features and get basic functions like tip-activated vibrations.

Offers you more control over the user's setup process, but fewer features for models.
